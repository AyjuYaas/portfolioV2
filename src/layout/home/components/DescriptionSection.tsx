        I'm a a passionate developer focused on building dynamic and responsive
        web applications using MERN. I enjoy creating clean, and minimal
        websites. Lately, I've been diving into AI and Machine Learning,
        exploring tools like TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and Keras to build fun
        and meaningful projects. I&apos;m especially interested in combining web
        development with intelligent systems to create smarter user experiences.
        <br />I am also exploring cyber security, and working my way through
        Spring Boot, to create a more secure website
